1. Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.

    Definition: Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself directly or indirectly to solve a problem. The process involves breaking down a problem into smaller, more manageable sub-problems.

    Key Concepts:
        Base Case: The condition under which the recursion stops, preventing infinite calls.
                   Recursive Case: The part where the function calls itself with modified arguments to work on a smaller piece of the problem.
        Benefits:
            Simplifies Complex Problems: Recursion can make code more intuitive and easier to understand for problems that can be naturally divided into similar sub-problems, such as tree traversal or factorial calculation.
            Reduces Code Complexity: Often leads to cleaner and shorter code compared to iterative solutions.
            
    Example: Calculating factorials or traversing a directory structure.

2. Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm.
    For the recursive algorithm, the recurrent relation is as follows:
        T(n) = T(n-1) + 1
        Easily, applying Master's Theorem for Decreasing Function, the time complexity is O(n).

3. Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation.
    Memoization:
        Concept: Store the results of expensive function calls and reuse them when the same inputs occur again.
        Implementation: Use a data structure like a hash table or array to cache previously computed results.
    Dynamic Programming:
        Concept: Break down a problem into simpler sub-problems and solve each sub-problem only once, storing their results.
        Implementation: Use a table (array) to store solutions to sub-problems and build up the solution to the overall problem.
    Tail Recursion:
        Concept: Ensure that the recursive call is the last operation in the function, allowing the compiler or interpreter to optimize and reuse stack frames.
        Implementation: Refactor the function to perform the recursive call as its last operation, making it eligible for tail call optimization.
